A* Search Algorithm
Graph search Algorithm that finds a path from a given initial node to a given goal node.
It employs a heuristic estimate that rank each node by an estimate of the best route that goes through that node.
It visits the nodes in order of this heuristic estimate.
The A* algorithm is therefore an example of best-first search.


Beam Search
Beam search is a search algorithm that is an optimization of best-first search.
Like best-first search, it uses a heuristic function to evaluate to the promise of each node it examines.
Beam search, however, only unfolds the first m most promising nodes at each depth, where m is a fixed number, the beam width.

Binary search 
Technique for finding a particular value in a linear array, by ruling out half of the data at each step.

Branch And Bound
A general algorithmic method for finding optimal solutions of various optimization problems, especially in discrete and combinatorial optimization.
