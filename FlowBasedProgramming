# FLOW-BASED PROGRAMMING




Panta rhei (Panta rhei) - Everything flows.




In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm that uses a "data factory" metaphor for designing and building applications.
FBP defines applications as networks of black box processes, which exchange data across predefined connections by message passing, where the connecctions are specified externally to the processes.
These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally.
FBP is thus naturally compnent-oriented.

FBP is a particular form of dataflow programming based on bounded buffers, information packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, and separate definition of connections.
